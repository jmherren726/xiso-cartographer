/*
 * The library screen (M8, docs/ui-style.md#library): the sections on the left, the games in a
 * list, the highlighted game's details beside it, and a footer. A asks before installing the
 * highlighted game (the map is a catalog: nothing installs unasked), and Back asks before
 * leaving for the dashboard. GAMES lists what can be installed, INSTALLED what's in the install
 * folder, and SETTINGS where games install (docs/formats/settings.md), Authentication (the
 * servers the map uses and their logins, with the archive.org account: log in and out, ADR
 * 0010) and Map sources (the map's own lines, added and removed: map.md §9); DOWNLOADS says it
 * isn't here yet. Y searches GAMES with the on-screen
 * keyboard (keyboard.h), which also takes the email and password. Plain C over ui_draw like the
 * widgets, tested on the PC (test_ui_library).
